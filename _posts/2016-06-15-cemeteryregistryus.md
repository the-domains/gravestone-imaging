  Cemetery Video Documentaries We visually document cemeteries whenever possible
  in order to provide reference and preserve history. We believe that cemeteries
  should not become lost just because the knowledge of their location is
  forgotten. Video overviews, as well as photos, assist in identifying,
  locating, and remembering our ancestors.
